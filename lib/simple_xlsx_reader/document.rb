      #
      # * `true` - simply takes the first row as the header row
      # * block - calls the block with successive rows until the block returns
      #   true, which it then uses that row for the headers. All data prior to
      #   finding the headers is ignored.
      # * hash - transforms the header row by replacing cells with keys matched
      #   by value, ex. `{id: /ID|Identity/, name: /Name/i, date: 'Date'}` would
      #   potentially yield the row `{id: 5, name: 'Jane', date: [Date object]}`
      #   instead of the headers from the sheet. It would also search for the
      #   row that matches at least one header, in case the header row isn't the
      #   first.

      # If rows have been slurped, #each will iterate the slurped rows instead.
